<h1>.Zip Domains and .Zip Files</h1>
<hr>
<p> A .zip file is a compressed file that holds many other folders and files. They compress these files into a single location. A .zip domain is a <strong>top-level domain (TLD)</strong> In the <strong>domain name system (DNS)</strong> that is meant to be used by businesses in <strong>storage media technology</strong>.</p>
<p>Businesses may use .zip domains to establish a unique online 
	presence since a website with “.zip” stands out compared to a website with the commonly used “.com”. They are usually secure and were released with the advantage of speed.</p>

		<p>.zip domains can be used in Phishing Attacks, where cybercriminals create deceptive websites on .zip domains that imitate legitimate platforms or services. These same platforms or services may also use legitimate .zip files, so users are more likely to trust a .zip domain since it appears like a .zip file.</p>

<h1>How to Protect Yourself</h1>
<hr>
<p>To protect against potential malicious use of .zip domains, it is important for people to be careful when downloading files from unfamiliar websites. It all depends on a user's judgment. They should verify the legitimacy and reputation of the source before proceeding with any downloads. It is also recommended to use reliable security software that can detect and prevent potential threats. </p>
<p><strong>Anti-Virus Protection</strong></p>
<p>If you download any file off of a .zip domain, then having an antivirus software will help safeguard your computer. You can use the built-in software called ‘Windows Defender’ or another 3rd party software such as McAfee or Norton to protect your computer. Although it is not a 100% guarantee, it will give your system a stronger chance of blocking any malicious file compared to having no anti-virus protection in place. </p>
<p><strong>Not All .Zip Domains are Dangerous</strong></p>
<p>It's worth noting that while .zip domains can be used maliciously, not all websites with this domain extension are harmful. Many legitimate websites use .zip domains to distribute software, archives, or other files securely. However, users should remain vigilant and take necessary precautions to stay safe online.</p>
